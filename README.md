# Procedure
1.Open a new schematic file within your project.</br>
2.Use the libraries provided in EAGLE or create custom libraries if necessary.</br>
3.Place components onto the schematic sheet by using the 'Add' tool.</br>
4.Connect the components using the 'Net' tool.</br>
5.Label nets appropriately to ensure clarity</br>
6.Once routing is complete, perform a ERC to ensure there are no errors and save the schematic.</br>
7.Click on the 'Generate/Switch to Board' icon to create a board from your schematic.</br>
8.EAGLE's board layout editor allows you to place components, route traces, and define board shapes.</br>
9.Arrange components on the board to optimize space usage and minimize signal interference.</br>
10.Route traces to connect components according to your schematic.</br>
11.Use the various routing and editing tools provided by EAGLE to ensure proper routing and avoid design rule violations.</br>
12.Once routing is complete, perform a design rule check (DRC) to ensure there are no errors and save the board layout.</br>
13.Go to File > CAM Processor and set up CAM jobs to generate Gerber files for your PCB layers.</br>
14.Verify generated files to ensure they contain all necessary information.</br>
15.Save the generated manufacturing files.</br>

# Theory

A mosquito repellent PCB board works by emitting ultrasonic or electromagnetic signals that disrupt the sensory receptors of mosquitoes. These signals are designed to be safe for humans but irritating for mosquitoes, deterring them from the area. The board may incorporate components like microcontrollers and transducers to generate and emit these signals. The theory behind this technology is based on exploiting the sensitivity of mosquito sensory systems to specific frequencies, creating an effective repellent effect without the need for chemical substances.


### Working 

A mosquito repellent PCB board functions by emitting ultrasonic waves or electromagnetic signals that disrupt the sensory receptors of mosquitoes, making the environment unpleasant for them. This technology utilizes components like microcontrollers and transducers, such as ultrasonic speakers or electromagnetic emitters, to generate specific frequencies known to be irritating to mosquitoes while safe for humans and pets. When these signals are emitted, they interfere with mosquitoes' ability to locate and feed on hosts, effectively deterring them from the area where the PCB board is installed. The continuous emission of these signals creates a repellent effect without relying on chemical substances, promoting safety for humans and pets. Mosquito repellent PCB boards are designed to operate safely within specified limits and can be powered by batteries or a wired connection, with activation controlled manually or automatically based on time intervals or motion sensors. This technology offers a non-toxic and environmentally friendly approach to mosquito control by leveraging targeted frequencies to disrupt mosquitoes' sensory perception.
